<h1>Fundamentals (what I know) </h1>

<div class="strategy"><h2>Strategy #50. &quot;Select Attributes from Actual Ones&quot; Strategy // establishing responsibilities / what I know (fundamentals) </h2>

<p>- This is an aspect of a software object coming to life: &quot;I know selective
things that describe the actual object that I'm an abstraction of.&quot; </p>

<p>- Select the attributes for your software objects, taken from the abundance of the
attributes that could be used to describe a corresponding actual (real-world) object. </p>

<p>- Consider attributes from a broad-sweeping perspective; then work your way into the
specific ones you need. Look at attributes in general, in this domain, and ultimately just
within this system's responsibilities. </p>
</div>

<div class="strategy"><h2>Strategy #51. &quot;Establish Usual Attributes&quot; Strategy // establishing responsibilities / what I know (fundamentals) </h2>

<p>- Include the attributes that come to mind when you first think about the object. </p>

<p>- Criteria: the system needs to know a given attribute value; the system has some way
to get that value. </p>

<p>- Examples: number, name, address, date, time, operational state, phone, status,
threshold, type. </p>
