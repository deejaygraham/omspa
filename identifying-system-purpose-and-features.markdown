# Identifying system purpose and features 


A purpose is an overall desired result, the aim of one's actions. Features are
specific capabilities for the system under consideration.

This section presents &amp;quotpurpose and features&quot; strategies.


*Str#3. &quot;Field Trips, Pictures, and Examples&quot; Strategy // identifying
purpose and features 

 Work with domain experts, ones well-versed in the business. 

 Ask for a guided tour; ask for a picture; ask for lots of examples. 

Str#3a. &quot;Multiple Learning Sources&quot; Strategy // identifying purpose and
features 

 Read about it; try out software for it; listen to domain experts! 

Str#3b. &quot;Build A Glossary&quot; Strategy // identifying purpose and features 

 Are you finding that people terms differently? Perhaps using different words to
convey the same meaning? Or giving different meanings to the same word? Not a surprise! 

 Recommendation: build a glossary using a three-column spreadsheet (term, dictionary
definition, project definition). 

Str#4. &quot;Identify Major Sources of Stress&quot; Strategy // identifying purpose
and features 

 Ask people about the most pressing problems that they face each day. &quot;What
stresses you out the most? What frightens you the most? What's the worst thing that could
happen to you while your boss is watching?&quot; 

 Look for ways to eliminate or reduce the impact of those problems. 

Str#5. &quot;Develop a Features List&quot; Strategy // identifying purpose and
features 

 Build a list of features. 

 Think through each feature: the feature, who it's for, and why it's important. 

 Use qualifiers to narrow the scope of the purpose and features statements. 

 Prioritize your features list. 

 Use the features list for planning and building frequent, tangible, working results. 

Str#6. &quot;Four Kinds of Features&quot; Strategy // identifying purpose and
features 

 Be certain to include features that cover the following: 

1. Log important information. 

2. Conduct business. 

3. Analyze business results. 

4. Interact with other systems. 

Str#6a. &quot;Add Features, Inspired by Patterns&quot; Strategy // identifying
purpose and features 

 Add features inspired by the stereotypical responsibilities of a participant (in
Patt#3, Participant-Transaction), transaction (in Patt#6, Transaction - Transaction Line
Item), and place (in Patt#4, Place-Transaction). 

 Examples: assess the performance of a participant (how many, how much), calculate the
total of a transaction, assess the performance of a place (how many, how much). 

Str#6b. &quot;Organize and Prioritize Features&quot; Strategy // identifying purpose
and features 

 Organize the features into &amp;quotfeature categories&quot; (also known as
&amp;quotuse cases&quot;). 

. Example: maintaining employee info; assigning employees; assessing employee
performance 

 Prioritize the features. 

. Identify the prioritization criteria. For example: normal sequence of business usage;
greatest risk; customer interest; management interest; ease of implementation. 

Str#7. &quot;Calculation Results and Decision Points&quot; Strategy // identifying
purpose and features 

 Add features that deliver calculation results. 

 Add features that support decision points. 

Str#8. &quot;Best and Worst Features&quot; Strategy // identifying purpose and
features 

 Ask users: 

 What are the best features of the current system? Of competitive systems? 

 What are the worst problems of the current system? Of competitive systems? 

 What are the unneeded features of the current system? Of competitive systems? 

Str#9. &quot;Top 10&quot; Strategy // identifying purpose and features 

 Build a list of features. 

 When you face an abundance of features (or classes, attributes, services), go after
the top 10. 

 Why: avoid being overwhelmed by a sea of low-level details. 

Str#10. &quot;Now and Later&quot; Strategy // identifying purpose and features 

 Consider current capabilities--and anticipated future capabilities. 

 Ask, &quot;How is it done now? How will it be done later, with the new system?&quot; 

 Look at things that people do to objects now, and consider features you can add (your
automated objects might be able to do those actions to themselves). 

Str#11. &quot;Reengineer on the Boundaries&quot; Strategy // identifying purpose and
features 

 Look at each organization or automated system boundary. 

 Look for duplicate efforts on each side of such a boundary. 

 Model the capability one time--and encourage some reengineering improvements for the
organization. 

Str#12. The &quot;Smarter Devices&quot; Strategy // identifying purpose and features


 Look for opportunities to use smarter devices, simplifying your object model and
reducing software development schedule and costs. 

 When building an object model in a field with rapidly changing data acquisition and
control technology, be sure to take a systems perspective, spanning both hardware and
software.
