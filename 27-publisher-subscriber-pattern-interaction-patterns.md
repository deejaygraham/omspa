# Patt#27. &quot;Publisher-Subscriber&quot; Pattern // interaction patterns 

 

Typical object interactions 

 notifySubscribers --&gt; receiveNotification (which, in turn, invokes
executeAction) 

Examples

system-interaction object 

 model-document; model-view 

 &quot;subsystem one&quot; object - &quot;subsystem two&quot; object. 

Combinations

human-interaction, data-management, and system-interaction pattern players (subscribers).
