<p>Model components -- HI, DM (who I know) </p>

<p></b><i>Strategy #79. &quot;Establish HI Object Connections&quot; Strategy // establishing
responsibilities / who I know (model components) </p>

<p></i>- For a window or report, include an object connection (expressed as an attribute)
to: the contents of the window, the objects it knows directly, to get the content it needs
to do its job (note that a window can use those objects to get to other objects,
indirectly). </p>

<p><i>Strategy #79a. &quot;Establish HI-PD Object Connections&quot; Strategy // establishing
responsibilities / who I know (model components) </p>

<p></i>- For a window, show &quot;who I know&quot; in text: </p>

<p>(a) A problem-domain container, to ask for a list </p>

<p>(b) An object (or objects) selected from a list </p>

<p>- For a PD object who needs to notify a window: </p>

<p>. Inherit the attribute &quot;subscribers&quot; and the service &quot;publish&quot; --
from a PDObject class -- and notify your subscribers when a change occurs (up to each
subscriber to decide what to do from there). </p>

<p><i>Strategy #80. &quot;Establish DM Object Connections&quot; Strategy // establishing
responsibilities / who I know (model components) </p>

<p></i>- For a data management object, include an object connection (expressed as an
attribute) to the problem-domain objects (all of the objects in some problem-domain class)
that it is responsible for. </p>
