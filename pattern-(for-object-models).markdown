# pattern (for object models)


An object-model pattern is a template of objects with stereotypical responsibilities
and interactions; the template may be applied again and again, by analogy. Patterns are
building blocks, very helpful in building effective object models. Patterns are
categorized into these pattern families:
* - fundamental pattern
* - transaction patterns
* - aggregate patterns
* - plan patterns
* - interaction patterns.
