Working out dynamics with scenarios

A scenario is a time-ordered sequence of object interactions. A scenario details
the object interactions that are needed to provide a specific feature for a system under
consideration.

Use scenarios to work out model dynamics, discovering additional responsibilities and
scenarios along the way.

Developers test against classes and scenarios; an independent test organization uses
scenarios for its testing, too.

In this section, you'll find scenario strategies, presented in these categories:
