# pattern (for object models)

<p>An object-model pattern is a template of objects with stereotypical responsibilities
and interactions; the template may be applied again and again, by analogy. Patterns are
building blocks, very helpful in building effective object models. Patterns are
categorized into these pattern families: </p>

<ul>
* - fundamental pattern </li>
* - transaction patterns </li>
* - aggregate patterns </li>
* - plan patterns </li>
* - interaction patterns. </li>
</ul>
