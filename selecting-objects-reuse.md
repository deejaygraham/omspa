Selecting objects--reuse


*Str#36. &quot;Select and Reuse an Analogous Class&quot; Strategy // selecting
objects (reuse) 

 Look for a class that might apply. 

 Consider synonyms. 

 Consider a more general name, using &quot;is a kind of.&quot; 

 Consider metaphors (corresponding objects) within analogous systems (a system that
has an analogous purpose). 

 Caution: Watch out for metaphors based on what people are doing. Focus on what people
act on instead, letting those objects do those things to themselves. (Reason why: do
otherwise, and you'll end up with controller objects and data objects, resulting in weaker
cohesion and higher coupling.) 

Str#37. &quot;Select and Reuse a Group of Interacting Objects&quot; Strategy //
selecting objects (reuse) 

 Reuse another instance of a pattern as is. 

 Reuse an instance of a pattern, specializing in one or more of its classes. 

 Reuse a pattern, by analogy. 

Related pattern: Patt#16. &quot;Group-Member&quot;
