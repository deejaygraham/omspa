# strategy


A strategy is specific how-to advice for getting something done -- practical, down to
earth, ready to apply. Nearly all object model strategies fit into one of four major
categories (four major activities):
* - identifying system purpose and features
* - selecting objects
* - establishing responsibilities
* - working out dynamics with scenarios.
* A few other strategies fit into one of two smaller categories:
* - activities and model components
* - discovering new strategies and patterns.
