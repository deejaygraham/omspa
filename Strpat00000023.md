<p>Selecting objects--reuse </p>

<p><i>Str#36. &quot;Select and Reuse an Analogous Class&quot; Strategy // selecting
objects (reuse) </p>

*  Look for a class that might apply. </p>

*  Consider synonyms. </p>

*  Consider a more general name, using &quot;is a kind of.&quot; </p>

*  Consider metaphors (corresponding objects) within analogous systems (a system that
has an analogous purpose). </p>

*  Caution: Watch out for metaphors based on what people are doing. Focus on what people
act on instead, letting those objects do those things to themselves. (Reason why: do
otherwise, and you'll end up with controller objects and data objects, resulting in weaker
cohesion and higher coupling.) </p>

<p><i>Str#37. &quot;Select and Reuse a Group of Interacting Objects&quot; Strategy //
selecting objects (reuse) </p>

*  Reuse another instance of a pattern as is. </p>

*  Reuse an instance of a pattern, specializing in one or more of its classes. </p>

*  Reuse a pattern, by analogy. </p>
