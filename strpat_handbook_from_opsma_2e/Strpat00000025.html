<p>Selecting objects--what to consider and challenge </p>

<p></b><i>Strategy #42. &quot;System Responsibility&quot; Strategy // selecting objects
(consider and challenge) </p>

<p>- Is the object something that your system is responsible to know or do anything
about? </p>

<p>- If not, put it in the &quot;not this time&quot; model component. </p>

<div class="strategy"><i>Strategy #43. &quot;Duplicate Responsibilities&quot; Strategy // selecting objects
(consider and challenge) </p>

<p>- Is this object just a duplication of another object? Are the names different, yet
identical responsibilities? </p>

<p>- Such duplications arise over time in large organizations and on large systems. </p>

<p>- When this happens, seek a common name (get help from dictionaries, a thesaurus, and
domain-specific books and articles). </p>

<div class="strategy"><i>Strategy #44. &quot;Reengineer with Objects&quot; Strategy // selecting objects (consider
and challenge) </p>

<p>- Look for objects (and repeating instances of a pattern) that are likely to have
the same responsibilities--and actually reflect an organizational boundary or previous
system boundary. </p>

<p>- Model the objects once--for a simpler object model. Make recommendations for
reengineering the organization, too. </p>

<div class="strategy"><i>Strategy #45. &quot;Useful Questions&quot; Strategy // selecting objects (consider and
challenge) </p>

<p>- What useful questions could you ask this object, if you include it in your object
model? </p>

<p>- Examples: How many over interval? How much over interval? How good are you? </p>

<div class="strategy"><i>Strategy #46. &quot;More Than a Report&quot; Strategy // selecting objects (consider and
challenge) </p>

<p>- Is that report simply a human interaction object, just a view of problem-domain
values and calculation results? Or does it embody something about which the system needs
to know and do something through time? </p>

<p>- Add to your object model, when your system is responsible for both producing and
remembering the content expressed in that report. </p>

<div class="strategy"><i>Strategy #47. &quot;Way to Know&quot; Strategy // selecting objects (consider and
challenge) </p>

<p>- You need a way to know each object--and its attribute values. </p>

<p>- If you have no way to know an object, either find a way to know about it or put the
object in the &quot;not this time&quot; model component. </p>

<p>- Example: customer. You must have a way to know about customer objects; otherwise, put
customer in the &quot;not this time&quot; model component. </p>

<div class="strategy"><i>Strategy #48. &quot;No Objects Mimicking What a Human Does&quot; Strategy // selecting
objects (consider and challenge) </p>

<p>- Don't let an object mimic what a person does (unless you are building a
simulation system). Otherwise, that object will end up as a controller, a function blob. </p>

<p>- Reasons why: </p>

<p>. The controller ends up with functionality that's better done by other objects
themselves (lower cohesion for all). </p>

<p>. The controller makes messaging more complicated (higher coupling for all). </p>

<p>. The overly busy controller is harder to develop. </p>

<p>. The overly busy controller is minding everyone else's state-dependent
responsibilities. </p>

<div class="strategy"><i>Strategy #49. &quot;Different Human Interaction&quot; Strategy // selecting objects
(consider and challenge) </p>

<p>- Consider how your model would change if you used a very different
human-interaction style (for example, using a heads-up display and voice commands). </p>

<p>- Would any of your problem-domain objects change? If so, pay close attention to those
objects. Separate presentation from what's really going on in the problem domain. </p>

<p>- Examples: vertical-speed indicator (human interaction) and vertical-speed gyro
(problem domain), traffic light (human interaction) and traffic lane (problem domain). </p>
