# Patt#21. &quot;Plan - Plan Execution&quot; Pattern // plan patterns 

 

Typical object interactions 

 calcAvgDuration --&gt; calcDuration 

 buildExecutionPlan --&gt; create 

Examples

 battle plan - battle execution, recipe - recipe execution, job - job execution,
procedure - procedure execution. 

Combinations 

Patt#20. &quot;Plan-Step&quot; 

Patt#23. &quot;Plan Execution - Step Execution&quot; 

Patt#24. &quot;Plan - Plan Version.&quot; 

Notes 

 This is an actual execution of a plan at a date and time. Use this pattern when a
plan may be executed several times. (If the plan is executed only once, the
responsibilities for plan execution could be added to a plan.)
