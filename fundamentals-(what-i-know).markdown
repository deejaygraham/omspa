Fundamentals (what I know)


*Str#50. &quot;Select Attributes from Actual Ones&quot; Strategy // establishing
responsibilities / what I know (fundamentals) 

 This is an aspect of a software object coming to life: &quot;I know selective
things that describe the actual object that I'm an abstraction of.&quot; 

 Select the attributes for your software objects, taken from the abundance of the
attributes that could be used to describe a corresponding actual (real-world) object. 

 Consider attributes from a broad-sweeping perspective; then work your way into the
specific ones you need. Look at attributes in general, in this domain, and ultimately just
within this system's responsibilities. 

Str#51. &quot;Establish Usual Attributes&quot; Strategy // establishing
responsibilities / what I know (fundamentals) 

 Include the attributes that come to mind when you first think about the object. 

 Criteria: the system needs to know a given attribute value; the system has some way
to get that value. 

 Examples: number, name, address, date, time, operational state, phone, status,
threshold, type.
