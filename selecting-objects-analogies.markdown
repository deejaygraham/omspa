Selecting objects--analogies


*Str#35. &quot;Select Corresponding Objects from Analogous Systems&quot; Strategy
// selecting objects (analogies) 

 Look for a system with an analogous purpose. 

. Take your system's purpose -- and generalize it. 

. . For example, &quot;to rent videos&quot; becomes &quot;to rent.&quot; 

. Look for other problem domains in need of an analogous system. 

. . For example, car rental system (to rent cars), consulting services system (to rent 

. . talent), airline reservation system (to rent a seat). 

 Examine objects in each analogous system, looking for ones that might correspond by
analogy to objects you need in your system. 

 Add the corresponding objects (grammatically, called &quot;metaphors&quot;) to your
object model.
