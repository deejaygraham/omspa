Descriptions (what I know)


*Str#58. &quot;Describe Attributes with a Template&quot; Strategy // establishing
responsibilities / what I know (descriptions) 

 Describe each attribute, using a template as your guide. 

. description 

. legal values (range; limit; enumeration of values) 

. unit of measure 

. data type 

. tolerance 

. required (yes or no) 

. get/set constraints 

. how to get a default value from another source, in the event a custom value is not
known 

. applicable states (for state-dependent attributes) 

. traceability codes (to a requesting document, if any). 

Str#59. &quot;Describe Real-Time Attributes&quot; Strategy // establishing
responsibilities / what I know (descriptions) 

 For real-time, categorize each attribute as: state, state-dependent, or
state-independent. 

 Examples: 

. state attributes: status, operational state 

. state-dependent attributes: value, reading 

. state-independent attributes: name, serial number.
