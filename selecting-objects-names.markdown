Selecting objects -- names


*Str#38. &quot;Use the Domain Vocabulary&quot; Strategy // selecting objects
(names) 

 Use the domain vocabulary. 

 Encourage domain experts to eliminate names of things that aren't their own. 

 Don't put words in your domain expert's mouth. 

 Don't change the vocabulary unless the domain expert feels the need to do so. 

 Don't change the domain vocabulary--unless your domain experts choose to change their
own vocabulary. 

Str#39. The &quot;Domain Terms and Add-Ons&quot; Strategy // selecting objects
(names) 

 Use a domain name in the problem domain component. 

 Use the same name, with a suffix, in the other components. 

 Examples: customer, customer window, customer DM; altimeter, altimeter indicator,
altimeter SI. 

Str#40. &quot;Always Look for a Better Class Name&quot; Strategy // selecting
objects (names) 

 Look for a better class name. 

. Consider synonyms. 

. Consider a more general name, using &quot;is a kind of.&quot; 

. Consider metaphors (corresponding objects) within analogous systems (a system that
has an analogous purpose). 

Str#41. &quot;Consistent Class Name Format&quot; Strategy // selecting objects
(names) 

 Use a name that describes an object in a class (usually that means a singular
name). 

 If an object is a collection, use a singular domain name; the plural of its parts; or
the part name plus &quot;collection&quot; or &quot;server.&quot; 

 In an object model, begin each class name with an uppercase letter (begin all other
names with a lowercase letter).
